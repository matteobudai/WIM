\section{Evaluation}
One problem encoutered is in the homepage. There are the icons of the Play and App Store but this two links don't work and doing this the website risks to lose the trust of the user and his available time.
However, the homepage has a simple and clear layout that separates the contents very well and the internal pages do the same.
The structure is simple but well organised, after a few clicks the user has a clear idea of where to look for what he needs. 
Moreover the search functionality helps the user if he doesn't know where what he's looking for is. 
After all the considerations made in the document, Sicilian Goodness is a good site for all types of users. It doesn't commit serious usability errors and according to the analysis of the 6 Ws it provides all the information a user needs when he navigates a site. \newline
In conclusion, the evaluation is positive and the final grade is 8/10.
